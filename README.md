This project shows a demonstration of server side rendering using react 

We have created a simple counter with two button to increment/decrement count. This project makes use of hydrateRoot (https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) which lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server

# Steps to run project

# Create a build
### `npm run build`
This will create a build folder with index.html file in it. We will use this html file to load as server side rendered html

# Start the server
### `npm run ssr`
Go to http://localhost:8000/ and navigate to network tab under development tools. Preview the file localhost. You will se that the html is rendered.
